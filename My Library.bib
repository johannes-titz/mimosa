  abstract = {Galileo Galilei (Italian: [ɡaliˈlɛːo ɡaliˈlɛi]; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642) was an Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath. Galileo has been called the "father of observational astronomy", the "father of modern physics", the "father of the scientific method", and the "father of modern science".Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and "hydrostatic balances", inventing the thermoscope and various military compasses, and using the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects. His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the observation of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, the observation of Saturn and the analysis of sunspots.
Galileo's championing of heliocentrism and Copernicanism was controversial during his lifetime, when most subscribed to geocentric models such as the Tychonic system. He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism because of the absence of an observed stellar parallax. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture". Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632), which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point. He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy", and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest. While under house arrest, he wrote Two New Sciences, in which he summarized work he had done some forty years earlier on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.},

These so-called 'nested designs' yield data that cannot be considered to be independent, and so violate the independency assumption of conventional statistical methods such as the t test. Ignoring this dependency results in a probability of incorrectly concluding that an effect is statistically significant that is far higher (up to 80\%) than the nominal α level (usually set at 5\%). We discuss the factors affecting the type I error rate and the statistical power in nested data, methods that accommodate dependency between observations and ways to determine the optimal study design when data are nested. Notably, optimization of experimental designs nearly always concerns collection of more truly independent observations, rather than more observations from one research object.},

  abstract = {A review of the historical measurement theory literature in psychology reveals a recurring focus on a physical rather than a psychological model of the measurement process, whereas the active measurement research literature points to an emphasis on elements of a psychological measurement process. On the basis of the relevant portions of these anomalous findings the authors outline parts of a general measurement structure for psychology that begins with an essential theoretical base. The review first explores a century-old statement that developed a promising starting point within test development. This is followed by a diversionary statement based on physical measurement that mandated discussions of measurement in psychology to a physical model. The statement appeared to be countered by the theory of scale types (Stevens, 1946), which provided a promising element of the psychological measurement process. The legacy of the theory of scales, however, resulted in confusion and inconsistency about the specifics of psychological measurement. After reviewing some of the contributions in the research literature, a conciliation of the positive theory efforts of the past and the protocols for a measurement process are presented that is based upon the standard system of measurement (Aftanas, 1988, 2006) as the basic theoretically necessary element of measurement. The theoretical framework based on the standard system promises not only to integrate the components of measurement, and categories of psychological measurement that have been referenced in the past, but also to provide an easily assimilated protocol that can serve as a basis for future research and pedagogical exposition.},

These laws have nomothetic generality across persons and cultures together with idiographic capability for true measurement of personal, individual value.

Methods for the estimation of power in two-level models have been based on formulas and Monte Carlo simulation. We provide a hands-on tutorial illustrating how a priori and post hoc power analyses for the most frequently used two-level models are conducted. We describe how a population model for the power analysis can be specified by using standardized input parameters and how the power analysis is implemented in SIMR, a very flexible power estimation method based on Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we provide case-sensitive rules of thumb for deriving sufficient sample sizes as well as minimum detectable effect sizes that yield a power ≥ .80 for the effects and input parameters most frequently analyzed by psychologists. For medium variance components, the results indicate that with lower level (L1) sample sizes up to 30 and higher level (L2) sample sizes up to 200, medium and large fixed effects can be detected. However, small L2 direct- or cross-level interaction effects cannot be detected with up to 200 clusters. The tutorial and guidelines should be of help to researchers dealing with multilevel study designs such as individuals clustered within groups or repeated measurements clustered within individuals.

  abstract = {Some disciplines in the social sciences rely heavily on collecting survey responses to detect empirical relationships among variables. We explored whether these relationships were a priori predictable from the semantic properties of the survey items, using language processing algorithms which are now available as new research methods. Language processing algorithms were used to calculate the semantic similarity among all items in state-of-the-art surveys from Organisational Behaviour research. These surveys covered areas such as transformational leadership, work motivation and work outcomes. This information was used to explain and predict the response patterns from real subjects. Semantic algorithms explained 60–86\% of the variance in the response patterns and allowed remarkably precise prediction of survey responses from humans, except in a personality test. Even the relationships between independent and their purported dependent variables were accurately predicted. This raises concern about the empirical nature of data collected through some surveys if results are already given a priori through the way subjects are being asked. Survey response patterns seem heavily determined by semantics. Language algorithms may suggest these prior to administering a survey. This study suggests that semantic algorithms are becoming new tools for the social sciences, opening perspectives on survey responses that prevalent psychometric theory cannot explain.},

  abstract = {The traditional understanding of data from Likert scales is that the quantifications involved result from measures of attitude strength. Applying a recently proposed semantic theory of survey response, we claim that survey responses tap two different sources: a mixture of attitudes plus the semantic structure of the survey. Exploring the degree to which individual responses are influenced by semantics, we hypothesized that in many cases, information about attitude strength is actually filtered out as noise in the commonly used correlation matrix. We developed a procedure to separate the semantic influence from attitude strength in individual response patterns, and compared these results to, respectively, the observed sample correlation matrices and the semantic similarity structures arising from text analysis algorithms. This was done with four datasets, comprising a total of 7,787 subjects and 27,461,502 observed item pair responses. As we argued, attitude strength seemed to account for much information about the individual respondents. However, this information did not seem to carry over into the observed sample correlation matrices, which instead converged around the semantic structures offered by the survey items. This is potentially disturbing for the traditional understanding of what survey data represent. We argue that this approach contributes to a better understanding of the cognitive processes involved in survey responses. In turn, this could help us make better use of the data that such methods provide.},

We projected well-known surveys measuring leadership, motivation and outcomes into large text samples from these three media domains significantly different impacts on survey responses. Business press language was best in explaining leadership-related items, PR language best at explaining organizational results and “ordinary” newspaper language seemed to explain the relationship among motivation items. These findings shed light on how different public arenas construct organizational realities in different ways, and how these differences have consequences on methodology in research on leadership.},

This study starts with an introduction to the semantic theory of survey response (STSR) and proceeds by offering a guided approach to conducting such analyses. The reader is presented with two types of semantic algorithms and a brief overview of how they are calculated and how they can be accessed by interested researchers. Subsequently, we use semantic data to reanalyze a previously published study on the relationships between perceptions of a trainee program, intrinsic motivation, and work outcomes. The semantic algorithms can explain between 31 and 55\% of the variation in the observed correlations. This article shows how the statistical models originally used to explore the survey data can be replicated using semantics either alone or as an identifiable source of variation in the data. All the steps are presented in detail, and the datasets as well as the statistical syntax necessary to perform the analyses are made available to the readers. Implications for methodology and the improvement of predictive validity in HRD research are discussed.},

While the experienced phenomenology has been investigated, there are no explanations about how one can have these experiences. Instead, the only recently discussed explanation suggests that the anecdotal phenomenology is due to memory effects and hence not really experienced during the accidents. The purpose of this article is i) to reintroduce the currently-forgotten comprehensively altered phenomenology that some people experience during the accidents, ii) to explain why the recent experiments fail to touch the issue at hand, and iii) to suggest a new framework to explain what happens when people experience time slowing down in these cases.

However, all but two of these studies have relied exclusively on Estimated DRF as the measure of DRF. The main goal of the present study was to evaluate the hypothesis that attitude towards dreams is not related to DRF but that it influences the estimated DRF through a process of selective attention. A secondary goal was to evaluate the adequacy of Estimated DRF as a measure of diary DRF as well as in relation to Attitude Towards Dreams. Participants’ (N=82) Attitude Towards Dreams and Estimated DRF were assessed by a self-reported questionnaire while diary DRF was calculated from a dream log. As predicted, Attitude Towards Dreams and diary DRF were independently related to Estimated DRF. In addition, estimations of DRF were found to be inaccurate; individuals with a negative attitude towards dreams were more likely to underestimate their diary DRF. The data show that the choice of DRF measures has a direct and significant impact on the pattern and magnitude of the relation between people’s DRF and their Attitude Towards Dreams.},

  abstract = {Scientific knowledge as opposed to common-sense knowledge entails a methodological revolution based on a search not for essences, in Aristotelian sense, but for mathematical functions, in Galilean sense, originated from the controlled experiment and founded on the concept of a closed or isolated system. The Priestley-Lavoisier dispute is an historical example that shows clearly the disjunction between pre-science and science. This methodological revolution has not yet been achieved in the field of “social sciences” for the persisting prejudices about dualism between man and nature. Starting from this situation, the paper emphasizes the need for a definition of the research about man and society that overcomes the obstacles and the presuppositions of philosophical ideology and common sense, according to the distinctive features of scientific inquiry and the corresponding requirements for the scientific language. In particular, with reference to the language of every science, the condition of semantic homogeneity of predicates is analyzed, and the main misunderstandings deriving from the non-conformity to this basic criterion (that have so far not allowed a development of a real social science) are pointed out; namely: (a) the consideration of the languages that designate the different fields of research (economics, psychology and sociology) as pairwise disjoint sets, even if there are clear intersections among them, and (b) the resort within the current “social sciences” language to pseudofunctions, whose domain is a set of internal (cognitive) events, or a set of biological events, and the range is a set of external (behavioral) events. According to these remarks, some criticisms to McIntyre’s paper, published in this issue, are formulated.},

We show that there are interesting parallels and connections between the two, by focusing on a real and detailed example (temperature) from the history of science. More specifically, our novel approach is to study the issue of validity based on the history of measurement in physics, which will lead to three concrete points that are relevant for the validity debate in psychology. First of all, studying the causal mechanisms underlying the measurements can be crucial for evaluating whether the measurements are valid. Secondly, psychologists would benefit from focusing more on the robustness of measurements. Finally, we argue that it is possible to make good science based on (relatively) bad measurements, and that the explanatory success of science can contribute to justifying the validity of measurements.},

There are also well-established research programmes into temporal perception, spatial perception and mathematical cognition that also reflect the subjective impression of how experience is constructed. There is of course no reason why the brain should respect these common sense, text book divisions and, here, we discuss the contention that generalized magnitude processing is a more accurate conceptual description of how the brain deals with information about time, space, number and other dimensions. The roots of the case for linking magnitudes are based on the use to which magnitude information is put (action), the way in which we learn about magnitudes (ontogeny), shared properties and locations of magnitude processing neurons, the effects of brain lesions and behavioural interference studies. Here, we assess this idea in the context of a theory of magnitude, which proposed common processing mechanisms of time, space, number and other dimensions.},

  abstract = {Summary
Background
Major depressive disorder is one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders worldwide in adults. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available; however, because of inadequate resources, antidepressants are used more frequently than psychological interventions. Prescription of these agents should be informed by the best available evidence. Therefore, we aimed to update and expand our previous work to compare and rank antidepressants for the acute treatment of adults with unipolar major depressive disorder.
Methods
We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, the websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers for published and unpublished, double-blind, randomised controlled trials from their inception to Jan 8, 2016. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 21 antidepressants used for the acute treatment of adults (≥18 years old and of both sexes) with major depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20\% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data. We assessed the studies' risk of bias in accordance to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (treatment discontinuations due to any cause). We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012002291.
Findings
We identified 28\hphantom{,}552 citations and of these included 522 trials comprising 116\hphantom{,}477 participants. In terms of efficacy, all antidepressants were more effective than placebo, with ORs ranging between 2·13 (95\% credible interval [CrI] 1·89–2·41) for amitriptyline and 1·37 (1·16–1·63) for reboxetine. For acceptability, only agomelatine (OR 0·84, 95\% CrI 0·72–0·97) and fluoxetine (0·88, 0·80–0·96) were associated with fewer dropouts than placebo, whereas clomipramine was worse than placebo (1·30, 1·01–1·68). When all trials were considered, differences in ORs between antidepressants ranged from 1·15 to 1·55 for efficacy and from 0·64 to 0·83 for acceptability, with wide CrIs on most of the comparative analyses. In head-to-head studies, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (range of ORs 1·19–1·96), whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone were the least efficacious drugs (0·51–0·84). For acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were more tolerable than other antidepressants (range of ORs 0·43–0·77), whereas amitriptyline, clomipramine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine had the highest dropout rates (1·30–2·32). 46 (9\%) of 522 trials were rated as high risk of bias, 380 (73\%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18\%) as low; and the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low.
Interpretation
All antidepressants were more efficacious than placebo in adults with major depressive disorder. Smaller differences between active drugs were found when placebo-controlled trials were included in the analysis, whereas there was more variability in efficacy and acceptability in head-to-head trials. These results should serve evidence-based practice and inform patients, physicians, guideline developers, and policy makers on the relative merits of the different antidepressants.

Across four experiments we found: (1) frequency judgments regarding one list were biased by the second, (2) manipulating encoding between lists improved source monitoring and resulted in more accurate judgments, (3) manipulating item context between lists improved source monitoring and resulted in more accurate judgments, but only when the context was item specific, and (4) manipulating simplebackground context between lists was ineffective at improving source monitoring.},

By convention, the principal techniques used to identify such processes are based on functional dissociation—the observation of selective effects of variables on tasks. Yet, despite their widespread use, the inferential logic associated with these techniques is flawed. The aims of this article are twofold: (a) to review and make explicit the inferential limits of single and double dissociation; and (b) to introduce a new technique that overcomes these limits. Called reversed association, this new technique is defined as any nonmonotonic relation between two tasks of interest. We argue that reversed association, in place of functional dissociation, offers a sounder basis for inferring the number of functionally independent processes underlying performance and, having fewer assumptions, offers researchers greater scope for discovering such processes and determining their nature and effects.

  abstract = {Mixed-effects models have emerged as the gold standard of statistical analysis in different sub-fields of linguistics (Baayen, Davidson \& Bates, 2008; Johnson, 2009; Barr, et al, 2013; Gries, 2015). One problematic feature of these models is their failure to converge under maximal (or even near-maximal) random effects structures. The lack of convergence is relatively unaddressed in linguistics and when it is addressed has resulted in statistical practices (e.g. Jaeger, 2009; Gries, 2015; Bates, et al, 2015b) that are premised on the idea that non-convergence is an indication that a random effects structure is over-specified (or not parsimonious), the parsimonious convergence hypothesis (PCH). We test the PCH by running simulations in lme4 under two sets of assumptions for both a linear dependent variable and a binary dependent variable in order to assess the rate of non-convergence for both types of mixed effects models when a known maximal effect structure is used to generate the data (i.e. when non-convergence cannot be explained by random effects with zero variance). Under the PCH, lack of convergence is treated as evidence against a more maximal random effects structure, but that result is not upheld with our simulations. We provide an alternative model, fully specified Bayesian models implemented in rstan (Stan Development Team, 2016; Carpenter, et al, in press) that removed the convergence problems almost entirely in simulations of the same conditions. These results indicate that when there is known non-zero variance for all slopes and intercepts, under realistic distributions of data and with moderate to severe imbalance, mixed effects models in lme4 have moderate to high non-convergence rates which can cause linguistic researchers to wrongfully exclude random effect terms.},

Across studies, participants answered binary-choice questions, following which they were told they answered correctly (success feedback) or incorrectly (failure feedback). Both types of feedback conveyed the correct answer, because there were only two answer choices. However, on a follow-up test, participants learned less from failure feedback than from success feedback. This effect was replicated across professional, linguistic, and social domains—even when learning from failure was less cognitively taxing than learning from success and even when learning was incentivized. Participants who received failure feedback also remembered fewer of their answer choices. Why does failure undermine learning? Failure is ego threatening, which causes people to tune out. Participants learned less from personal failure than from personal success, yet they learned just as much from other people’s failure as from others’ success. Thus, when ego concerns are muted, people tune in and learn from failure.},

In addition, we examined whether state anger, state rumination, and state empathy mediate this relationship. Using a large sample (N=1040), we found that admiration was negatively related to revenge and avoidance via higher empathy for the transgressor. By contrast, rivalry was positively related to revenge and avoidance via greater anger and rumination and less empathy. Findings suggest that the mechanisms through which narcissism and lack of forgiveness are associated are better understood if we disentangle admiration and rivalry and consider both cognitive and affective antecedents of narcissists’ unforgiving motivations.},

Questionnaires planned to collect judgments on qualitative or linguistic scales, whose levels are terms such as ‘‘good,’ ’ ‘‘bad,’ ’ ‘‘medium,’ ’ etc., are extensively used both in evaluating service quality and in visual controls for manufacturing industry. In an ordinal environment, the concept of distance between two generic levels of the same scale is not defined. Therefore, a population (universe) of judgments cannot be described using ‘‘traditional’ ’ statistical distributions since they are based on the notion of distance. The concept of ‘‘distribution shape’’ cannot be defined as well. In this article, we introduce a new statistical entity, the so-called ordinal distribution, to describe a population of judgments expressed on an ordinal scale. We also discuss which of the traditional location and dispersion measures can be used in this context and we briefly analyze some of their properties. A new dispersion measure, the ordinal range, as an extension of the cardinal range to ordinal scales, is then proposed. A practical application in the field of quality is developed throughout the article.},

  abstract = {Noradrenaline, essential for the modulation of memory, is released in various parts of the brain from nerve terminals controlled by the locus coeruleus (LoC). Noradrenaline release consequent upon input from higher brain areas also occurs within the LoC itself. We examined the effect of noradrenaline on adrenergic receptors in the LoC on memory processing, using colored bead discrimination learning in the young domestic chick. We have shown previously that the release of noradrenaline in the hippocampus and cortex (mesopallium) is essential for acquisition and consolidation of short-term to intermediate and to long-term memory. Noradrenaline release within the LoC is triggered by the glutamatergic input from the forebrain. Inhibition by LoC injection of NMDA or AMPA receptor antagonists is rescued by injection of β2-and β3-adrenoceptor (AR) agonists in the hippocampus. We show that inhibition of α2A-ARs by BRL44408 in the LoC up to 30 min post-training consolidates weakly-reinforced learning. Conversely activation of α2A-ARs in the LoC at the times of consolidation between short-term and intermediate and long-term memory caused memory loss, which is likely to be due to a decreased release of noradrenaline within these two time windows. The α2A-AR antagonist will block presynaptic inhibitory receptors leading to an increase in extracellular noradrenaline. This interpretation is supported by the actions of noradrenaline uptake blockers that produce the same memory outcome. BRL44408 in the mesopallium also caused memory enhancement. β2-ARs are important in the first time window, whereas α1-, α2C-and β3-ARs are important in the second time window. The results reveal that for successful memory formation noradrenaline release is necessary within the LoC as well as in other brain regions, at the time of consolidation of memory from short-term to intermediate and from intermediate to long-term memory. © 2010 IBRO.},

Suggested explanations include discrimination, and differences in preferences and human capital. In this paper we present experimental evidence in support of an additional explanation: When women and men compete against one another, women may perform less well than men, even if they perform similarly in noncompetitive environments. We observe a significantly higher gender gap in performance in mixed sex tournaments, than when participants are paid piece rates: This is driven by a large and significant increase in the performance of men, that of women is unchanged. This gender gap is not due to gender differences in risk aversion. We then have men and women compete in single sex tournaments, to investigate whether women under-perform only when competing against men. Women do indeed increase their performance and gender differences in mean performance are now insignificant. Hence women can be observed to perform well in competitive environments, but less so in mixed gender ones. These results may be due to lower skill of women, or more likely to the fact that women dislike competition, or alternatively that they feel less competent than their male competitors, which depresses their performance in mixed tournaments. Our last experiment provides support for this hypothesis.},

The present paper will deal with the analysis of curves that result when the difference between experimental treatments involves a scaled independent variable with equal steps (or equal-logarithmic steps) between levels of the independent variable. Examples would be learning curves, extinction curves, dark adaptation curves, time-to-attain a level of dark adaptation as a function of the luminance of the preadaptation field, response rate as a function of the amount of reinforcement, etc. The procedures apply to most curves or sets of curves in which y, the dependent variable, is plotted as a function of x, the independent variable, where there are equal intervals between the values of x. It is assumed that there is random normal variation in the dependent variable at each data point with equal error variances. There may or may not be parameters expressing qualitative or quantitative variation of additional independent variables that are orthogonal to x.

It is argued here that this is a highly unlikely scenario in psychology given the contingent and opportunistic character of the processes that brought its original topics together into a new discipline, and the nearly continuous institutional, social, and even political negotiating and horse-trading that has determined psychology’s “boundaries” in the 14 decades since. Psychology, as the field currently stands, does not have the intellectual coherence to be brought together by any set of principles that would enable its phenomena to be captured and explained as rigorous products of those principles. If there is a kind of unification in psychology’s future, it is more likely to be one that, paradoxically, sees it broken up into a number of large “super-subdisciplines,” each of which exhibits more internal coherence than does the current sprawling and heterogeneous whole.},

This development was spearheaded by a few highly influential introductory articles that ( i) showed how these regression models are superior to what was the previous gold standard and, perhaps even more importantly, ( ii) showed how these models are used practically. Corpus linguistics can benefit from mixed-effects/multi-level models for the same reason that psycholinguistics can - because, for example, speaker-specific and lexically specific idiosyncrasies can be accounted for elegantly; but, in fact, corpus linguistics needs them even more because ( i) corpus-linguistic data are observational and, thus, usually unbalanced and messy/noisy, and ( ii) most widely used corpora come with a hierarchical structure that corpus linguists routinely fail to consider. Unlike nearly all overviews of mixed-effects/multi-level modelling, this paper is specifically written for corpus linguists to get more of them to start using these techniques more. After a short methodological history, I provide a non-technical introduction to mixed-effects models and then discuss in detail one example - particle placement in English - to show how mixed-effects/multi-level modelling results can be obtained and how they are far superior to those of traditional regression modelling.},

We also discuss future directions for distinguishing between these models, which will be important for understanding the neural consequences of repetition and for interpreting repetition-related effects in neuroimaging data.},

After distinguishing the main contemporary issues related to time perception, the article focuses on the main findings and explanations that are available in the literature on explicit judgments about temporal intervals. The review emphasizes studies that are concerned with the processing of intervals lasting a few milliseconds to several seconds and covers studies issuing from either a behavioral or a neuroscience approach. It also discusses the question of whether there is an internal clock (pacemaker counter or oscillator device) that is dedicated to temporal processing and reports the main hypotheses regarding the involvement of biological structures in time perception.},

With regard to the latter, the tremendous worldwide success of mobile electronics (cell phones, smartphones, laptops, etc.) in part relies on batteries capable of high power and energy densities. An even wider market expansion is expected in the coming years from electric vehicles, which demand batteries that feature high ranges at low costs. In this framework, intense efforts are being devoted to the development of improved batteries, with the aim of capturing a market that is expected to boom in the coming decades [1], [2]. However, apart from being expected to thrive in a bright future, batteries also boast a glorious past.},

  abstract = {Individual differences in cognitive paradigms are increasingly employed to relate cognition to brain structure, chemistry, and function. However, such efforts are often unfruitful, even with the most well established tasks. Here we offer an explanation for failures in the application of robust cognitive paradigms to the study of individual differences. Experimental effects become well established – and thus those tasks become popular – when between-subject variability is low. However, low between-subject variability causes low reliability for individual differences, destroying replicable correlations with other factors and potentially undermining published conclusions drawn from correlational relationships. Though these statistical issues have a long history in psychology, they are widely overlooked in cognitive psychology and neuroscience today. In three studies, we assessed test-retest reliability of seven classic tasks: Eriksen Flanker, Stroop, stop-signal, go/no-go, Posner cueing, Navon, and Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Code (SNARC). Reliabilities ranged from 0 to .82, being surprisingly low for most tasks given their common use. As we predicted, this emerged from low variance between individuals rather than high measurement variance. In other words, the very reason such tasks produce robust and easily replicable experimental effects – low between-participant variability – makes their use as correlational tools problematic. We demonstrate that taking such reliability estimates into account has the potential to qualitatively change theoretical conclusions. The implications of our findings are that well-established approaches in experimental psychology and neuropsychology may not directly translate to the study of individual differences in brain structure, chemistry, and function, and alternative metrics may be required.},

II and III, the spacing or number of items intervening between 2 repetitions was varied (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 items). Apparent frequency increased with spacing. A slight primacy effect was found in all 3 studies. Results were consistent with a 2-stage consolidation theory of memory. (22 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Dependent variables were: judgment of frequency (JOF), judgment of duration (JOD), recognition performance, and free recall. JOF, recognition, and free recall were highly correlated with F, but relatively unaffected by D. JOD, in contrast, was affected by both F and D, showing that D does have an effect on memory. It is suggested that JOF is based on the strength of the long-term memory trace, while JOD is based partly on strength and partly on an independent dimension of the trace related to D. The total-time hypothesis does not appear to hold when D is manipulated within lists.},

Shiffrin (see record 1972-10191-001) that complex visual scenes are not rehearsed in testing the hypothesis that the effect of spacing on memory is due to rehearsal. In Exp I with 27 paid volunteers, a list of vacation slides was presented in which both the number of repetitions and the spacing of repetitions were varied. Subsequent frequency judgments showed an effect of spacing much like that found using verbal materials. In Exp II and III with 35 and 41 Ss, respectively, effects of filled and unfilled spacing intervals were compared, and it was concluded that the spacing effect is primarily a function of the duration of the spacing interval. No evidence supported the notion that pictures are rehearsed. Rehearsal apparently cannot play the key role in an adequate, completely general explanation of the spacing effect.

In Experiment I, the duration of the first presentation (P(1)) was manipulated, as was P(1)-P(2) spacing. The effect of spacing on judged frequency was independent of P(1) duration. In Experiment II, pictures were given M massed presentations just prior to the P(M)-P(M+1) spacing interval. The form of the spacing curve was independent of M. Neither experiment confirmed the prediction of "overhabituation," derived from the habituation-recovery explanation of the spacing effect. In Experiment III, subjects made both duration and frequency judgments. The duration judgment results were not consistent with the notion that subjects remember multiple massed presentations as single occurrences of especially long duration. Some evidence from Experiments I and III suggests that an interrupted stimulus is recognized better than one that is not interrupted-a finding that, if replicable, would support the habituation-recovery account of the spacing effect.},

  abstract = {Perception is a product of evolution. Our perceptual systems, like our limbs and livers, have been shaped by natural selection. The effects of selection on perception can be studied using evolutionary games and genetic algorithms. To this end, we define and classify perceptual strategies and allow them to compete in evolutionary games in a variety of worlds with a variety of fitness functions. We find that veridical perceptions--strategies tuned to the true structure of the world--are routinely dominated by nonveridical strategies tuned to fitness. Veridical perceptions escape extinction only if fitness varies monotonically with truth. Thus, a perceptual strategy favored by selection is best thought of not as a window on truth but as akin to a windows interface of a PC. Just as the color and shape of an icon for a text file do not entail that the text file itself has a color or shape, so also our perceptions of space-time and objects do not entail (by the Invention of Space-Time Theorem) that objective reality has the structure of space-time and objects. An interface serves to guide useful actions, not to resemble truth. Indeed, an interface hides the truth; for someone editing a paper or photo, seeing transistors and firmware is an irrelevant hindrance. For the perceptions of H. sapiens, space-time is the desktop and physical objects are the icons. Our perceptions of space-time and objects have been shaped by natural selection to hide the truth and guide adaptive behaviors. Perception is an adaptive interface.},

  abstract = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre—layout (or conventional) and layout—specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

Two experiments contrast the processing of simpler versus more complex sentences. The two more complex sentence types, object-relative center-embedded sentences and filler-gap sentences, not only take longer to process than their simpler counterparts, but they also produce a larger change in pupil diameter. We propose that the pupillary response is an indicator of how intensely the processing system is operating. The more complex sentences evoke some intense processing at the point in the sentence where a syntactic complexity is first encountered. The gaze durations at these points are elevated, indicating the immediate response to the demand of the syntactic processing. The pupil then starts to dilate, reaching a maximal diameter approximately 1.3 s later. The results from these various performance measures are integrated within a resource-limited computational model of comprehension. The paper develops a model of comprehension that includes an intensity dimension of thought, drawing a correspondence between the computational model's consumption of resources and the human pupillary response.},

At retrieval, studied and new stimuli were rated as novel, familiar (strong, moderate, or weak), or recollected. We found that both pupil response and fixation patterns at encoding predict later recognition memory strength. The extent of pupillary response accompanying incidental encoding was found to be predictive of subsequent memory. In addition, the number of fixations was also predictive of later recognition memory strength, suggesting that the accumulation of greater visual detail, even for single objects, is critical for the creation of a strong memory. Moreover, fixation patterns at encoding distinguished between recollection and familiarity at retrieval, with more dispersed fixations predicting familiarity and more clustered fixations predicting recollection. These data reveal close links between the autonomic control of pupil responses and eye movement patterns on the one hand and memory encoding on the other. Moreover, the data illustrate quantitative as well as qualitative differences in the incidental visual processing of stimuli, which are differentially predictive of the strength and the kind of memory experienced at recognition.},

In both experiments, the use of a modified remember/know procedure led to high confidence and matched accuracy levels characterising strong familiarity (F3) and recollection (R) responses. In Experiment 1, visual scanning behaviour at retrieval distinguished familiarity-based from recollection-based recognition. Recollection, relative to strength-matched familiarity, involved significantly larger pupil dilations and more dispersed fixation patterns. In Experiment 2, the hippocampus was selectively activated for recollected stimuli, while no evidence of activation was observed in the hippocampus for strong familiarity of matched accuracy. Recollection also activated the parahippocampal cortex (PHC), while the adjacent perirhinal cortex (PRC) was actively engaged in response to strong familiarity (than to recollection). Activity in prefrontal and parietal areas differentiated familiarity and recollection in both the extent and the magnitude of activity they exhibited, while the dorsomedial thalamus showed selective familiarity-related activity, and the ventrolateral and anterior thalamus selective recollection-related activity. These findings are consistent with the view that the hippocampus and PRC play contrasting roles in supporting recollection and familiarity and that these differences are not a result of differences in memory strength. Overall, the combined pupil dilation, eye movement and fMRI data suggest the operation of recognition mechanisms drawing differentially on familiarity and recollection, whose neural bases are distinct within the MTL. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this article we develop a general theory for sequential estimation procedure for constructing a narrow confidence interval for a general class of effect sizes with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95\%) and a specified upper bound on the confidence interval width. Our method does not require prespecified, yet usually unknowable, population values of certain parameters for certain types of distributions, thus offering advantages compared to commonly used approaches to sample size planning. Importantly, we make our developments in a distribution-free environment and thus do not make untenable assumptions about the population from which observations are sampled. Our work is thus very general, timely due to the interest in effect sizes, and has wide applicability in the context of estimation of a general class of effect sizes.

We support this claim by drawing on empirical results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, psychopathology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson’s Paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encountered—including a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson’s Paradox. We show that explicit modeling of situations in which the paradox might occur not only prevents incorrect interpretations of data, but also results in a deeper understanding of what data tell us about the world.},

Stimuli were presented both aurally and visually, controlling for all known visual influences on pupil diameter. The patterns of dilation were similar for both aural and visual presentation for all three tasks, but the magnitudes of pupil response were greater for aural presentation. Accuracy was higher for visual presentation for mental arithmetic and digit recall.

In this review, evidence is presented supporting the hypothesis that clonidinelike drugs act either directly or indirectly on CNS postsynaptic ??2-adrenoceptors to cause pupillary dilation by reduction of parasympathetic neural tone to the iris. It is further suggested that the underlying physiologic mechanism for this mydriatic action is activation of an ascending pathway that provides tonic inhibitory input by releasing norepinephrine on neurons in the Edinger-Westphal complex. Yohimbine-sensitive pupillary dilation in these species may provide a simple and effective model for quantitatively accessing CNS ??2-adrenoceptor activity. ?? 1986.},

  abstract = {In psychology as elsewhere, the main statistical inference strategy to establish empirical effects is null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST). The recent failure to replicate allegedly well-established NHST-results, however, implies that such results lack sufficient statistical power, and thus feature unacceptably high error-rates. Using data-simulation to estimate the error-rates of NHST-results, we advocate the research program strategy (RPS) as a superior methodology. RPS integrates Frequentist with Bayesian inference elements, and leads from a preliminary discovery against a (random) H0-hypothesis to a statistical H1-verification. Not only do RPS-results feature significantly lower error-rates than NHST-results, RPS also addresses key-deficits of a “pure” Frequentist and a standard Bayesian approach. In particular, RPS aggregates underpowered results safely. RPS therefore provides a tool to regain the trust the discipline had lost along the ongoing replicability-crisis.},

  abstract = {Running studies with high statistical power, while effect size estimates in psychology are often inaccurate, leads to a practical challenge when designing an experiment. This challenge can be addressed by performing sequential analyses while the data collection is still in progress. At an interim analysis, data collection can be stopped whenever the results are convincing enough to conclude that an effect is present, more data can be collected, or the study can be terminated whenever it is extremely unlikely that the predicted effect will be observed if data collection would be continued. Such interim analyses can be performed while controlling the Type 1 error rate. Sequential analyses can greatly improve the efficiency with which data are collected. Additional flexibility is provided by adaptive designs where sample sizes are increased on the basis of the observed effect size. The need for pre-registration, ways to prevent experimenter bias, and a comparison between Bayesian approaches and null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) are discussed. Sequential analyses, which are widely used in large-scale medical trials, provide an efficient way to perform high-powered informative experiments. I hope this introduction will provide a practical primer that allows researchers to incorporate sequential analyses in their research. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this article, we provide a practical introduction to recently developed statistical tools that can be used to deal with these uncertainties when performing and evaluating research. In Part 1, we discuss the importance of accurate and stable effect size estimates as well as how to design studies to reach a corridor of stability around effect size estimates. In Part 2, we explain how, given uncertain effect size estimates, well-powered studies can be designed with sequential analyses. In Part 3, we (a) explain what p values convey about the likelihood that an effect is true, (b) illustrate how the v statistic can be used to evaluate the accuracy of individual studies, and (c) show how the evidential value of multiple studies can be examined with a p-curve analysis. We end by discussing the consequences of incorporating our recommendations in terms of a reduced quantity, but increased quality, of the research output. We hope that the practical recommendations discussed in this article will provide researchers with the tools to make important steps toward a psychological science that allows researchers to differentiate among all possible truths on the basis of their likelihood.},

  abstract = {The empirical study of the axioms underlying additive conjoint measurement initially focused mostly on the double cancellation axiom. That axiom was shown to exhibit redundant features that made its statistical evaluation a major challenge. The special case of double cancellation where inequalities are replaced by indifferences – the Thomsen condition – turned out in the full axiomatic context to be equivalent to the double cancellation property but without exhibiting the redundancies of double cancellation. However, it too has some undesirable features when it comes to its empirical evaluation, the chief among them being a certain statistical asymmetry in estimates used to evaluate it, namely two interlocked hypotheses and a single conclusion. Nevertheless, thinking we had no choice, we evaluated the Thomsen condition for both loudness and brightness and, in agreement with other lines of research, we found more support for conjoint additivity than not. However, we commented on the difficulties we had encountered in evaluating it. Thus we sought a more symmetric replacement, which as Gigerenzer and Strube (1983) first noted, is found in the conjoint commutativity axiom proposed by Falmagne (1976, who called it the ‘‘commutative rule’’). It turns out that, in the presence of the usual structural and other necessary assumptions of additive conjoint measurement, we can show that conjoint commutativity is equivalent to the Thomsen condition, a result that seems to have been overlooked in the literature. We subjected this property to empirical evaluation for both loudness and brightness. In contrast to Gigerenzer and Strube (1983), our data show support for the conjoint commutativity in both domains and thus for conjoint additivity.},

Strategic Pluralism Theory (Gangestad \& Simpson, 2000) predicts that men’s orientation toward uncommitted mating is facultatively calibrated (i.e. contingently adjusted over ontogeny) in response to condition-dependent physical features, such as strength and attractiveness. Herein, we suggest that previous research bearing on this hypothesis has been limited because (a) researchers have often neglected to distinguish between mating orientations and past sexual behavior and (b) sample sizes have not always been large enough to reliably detect correlations of moderate magnitude. To address these issues and extend previous findings, we present aggregated data from three independent samples of young adults that permit us to examine multiple measures of physical strength and attractiveness in relation to uncommitted mating orientation, committed mating orientation, and past sexual behavior. As predicted, meta-analyses across samples demonstrated that strength and attractiveness were positively correlated with men’s (but not women’s) uncommitted mating orientation (but not committed mating orientation). In addition, strength (in men only) and attractiveness (in both sexes) positively predicted participants’ number of past sex partners. Moreover, path analyses demonstrated that the association of men’s physical features with their number of sex partners was mediated via uncommitted mating orientation. These results (a) provide the most extensive support to date for the hypothesis that men’s uncommitted mating orientation is calibrated to condition-dependent features and (b) clarify the sex-specific functional links among physical features, mating orientations and sexual behavior.},

Researchers have observed considerable covariation among these and other economic games, leading them to assert that there exists a general human propensity to cooperate that varies in strength across individuals and manifests itself across a variety of social settings. To formalize this hypothesis, we created an S-1 bifactor model using 276 participants' Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions. The general factor had significant, moderate associations with self-reported and peer-reported altruism, trust, and trustworthiness. Thus, the positive covariation among economic games is not reducible to the games' shared situational features. Two hundred participants returned for a second session. The general factor based on Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions from this session did not significantly predict self-reported and peer-reported cooperation, suggesting that experience with economic games causes them to measure different traits from those that are reflected in self-assessments and peer-assessments of cooperativeness. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

Our simulation covers both restrictive settings as well as more realistic settings and proceeds across multiple metrics that assess different aspects of model performance. This evaluation is timely in light of two recently proposed approaches, the so-called p-curve and p-uniform approaches, that can be viewed as alternative implementations of the original Hedges selection method approach. We find that the p-curve and p-uniform approaches perform reasonably well but not as well as the original Hedges approach in the restrictive setting for which all three were designed. We also find they perform poorly in more realistic settings, whereas variants of the Hedges approach perform well. We conclude by urging caution in the application of selection methods: Given the idealistic model assumptions underlying selection methods and the sensitivity of population average effect size estimates to them, we advocate that selection methods should be used less for obtaining a single estimate that purports to adjust for publication bias ex post and more for sensitivity analysis—that is, exploring the range of estimates that result from assuming different forms of and severity of publication bias.},

In Experiment 1, rats initially learned a discrimination between a two-cycle auditory signal of 2-sec duration and an eight-cycle auditory signal of 8-sec duration. For the number discrimination test, the number of cycles was varied, and the signal duration was held constant at an intermediate value. For the duration discrimination test, the signal duration was varied, and the number of cycles was held constant at an intermediate value. Rats were equally sensitive to a 4:1 ratio of counts (with duration controlled) and a 4:1 ratio of times (with number controlled). The point of subjective equality for the psychophysical functions that related response classification to signal value was near the geometric mean of the extreme values for both number and duration discriminations. Experiment 2 demonstrated that 1.5 mg/kg of methamphetamine administered intraperitoneally shifted the psychophysical functions for both number and duration leftward by approximately 10\%. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the magnitude of cross-modal transfer from auditory signals to cutaneous signals was similar for number and duration. In Experiment 4 the mapping of number onto duration demonstrated that a count was approximately equal to 200 msec. The psychophysical functions for number and duration were fit with a scalar expectancy model with the same parameter values for each attribute. The conclusion was that the same internal mechanism is used for counting and timing. This mechanism can be used in several modes: the "event" mode for counting or the "run" and the "stop" modes for timing.},

Identification accuracy rates for both young and older participants were significantly higher under the long exposure condition. In the short exposure condition, witnesses who had made a correct identification of the target were more confident than incorrect witnesses. In the long exposure condition the confidence ratings of accurate and inaccurate witnesses did not differ. Discussion focuses on the extent to which extended exposure may inflate confidence judgments and variables that may moderate the relationship between exposure duration and face recognition accuracy.},

Most of the founders of the discipline committed it and it makes sense of otherwise anomalous developments within the discipline, such as the permissible statistics controversy and the dominant form taken by item response theories. The fallacy is displayed by showing (1) that an attribute's quantitative structure reduces to a weak order upon differences between degrees that satisfies the double cancellation, solvability, and Archimedean conditions of conjoint measurement theory and (2) the fact that any order on the degrees themselves does not entail sufficient structure on this weak order to guarantee satisfaction of these conditions. Thus, it is possible that an ordered attribute is non-quantitative. Also, each pair of differences between degrees of an ordinal attribute falls into one of two disjoint classes: (1) those where the order relation between the pair follows from an order on the attribute and (2) those where it is independent of that order and possibly diagnostic of quantitative structure and this fact means that the distinction between order and quantity is an empirical one.},

  abstract = {A conventional study design among medical and biological experimentalists involves collecting multiple measurements from a study subject. For example, experiments utilizing mouse models in neuroscience often involve collecting multiple neuron measurements per mouse to increase the number of observations without requiring a large number of mice. This leads to a form of statistical dependence referred to as clustering. Inappropriate analyses of clustered data have resulted in several recent critiques of neuroscience research that suggest the bar for statistical analyses within the field is set too low. We compare naïve analytical approaches to marginal, fixed-effect, and mixed-effect models and provide guidelines for when each of these models is most appropriate based on study design. We demonstrate the influence of clustering on a between-mouse treatment effect, a within-mouse treatment effect, and an interaction effect between the two. Our analyses demonstrate that these statistical approaches can give substantially different results, primarily when the analyses include a between-mouse treatment effect. In a novel analysis from a neuroscience perspective, we also refine the mixed-effect approach through the inclusion of an aggregate mouse-level counterpart to a within-mouse (neuron level) treatment as an additional predictor by adapting an advanced modeling technique that has been used in social science research and show that this yields more informative results. Based on these findings, we emphasize the importance of appropriate analyses of clustered data, and we aim for this work to serve as a resource for when one is deciding which approach will work best for a given study.},

  abstract = {Declarative memories of personal experiences are a key factor in defining oneself as an individual, which becomes particularly evident when this capability is impaired. Assessing the physiological mechanisms of human declarative memory is typically restricted to patients with specific lesions and requires invasive brain access or functional imaging. We investigated whether the pupil, an accessible physiological measure, can be utilized to probe memories for complex natural visual scenes. During memory encoding, scenes that were later remembered elicited a stronger pupil constriction compared to scenes that were later forgotten. Thus, pupil size predicts success or failure of memory formation. In contrast, novel scenes elicited stronger pupil constriction than familiar scenes during retrieval. When viewing previously memorized scenes, those that were forgotten (misjudged as novel) still elicited stronger pupil constrictions than those correctly judged as familiar. Furthermore, pupil constriction was influenced more strongly if images were judged with high confidence. Thus, we propose that pupil constriction can serve as a marker of novelty. Since stimulus novelty modulates the efficacy of memory formation, our pupil measurements during learning indicate that the later forgotten images were perceived as less novel than the later remembered pictures. Taken together, our data provide evidence that pupil constriction is a physiological correlate of a neural novelty signal during formation and retrieval of declarative memories for complex, natural scenes.},

However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called [Formula: see text] for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

Self-compassion is an emotionally positive self-attitude that should protect against the negative consequences of self-judgment, isolation, and rumination (such as depression). Because of its non-evaluative and interconnected nature, it should also counter the tendencies towards narcissism, self-centeredness, and downward social comparison that have been associated with attempts to maintain self-esteem.

  abstract = {Most popular strategies to capture subjective judgments from humans involve the construction of a unidimensional relative measurement scale, representing order preferences or judgments about a set of objects or conditions. This information is generally captured by means of direct scoring, either in the form of a Likert or cardinal scale, or by comparative judgments in pairs or sets. In this sense, the use of pairwise comparisons is becoming increasingly popular because of the simplicity of this experimental procedure. However, this strategy requires non-trivial data analysis to aggregate the comparison ranks into a quality scale and analyse the results, in order to take full advantage of the collected data. This paper explains the process of translating pairwise comparison data into a measurement scale, discusses the benefits and limitations of such scaling methods and introduces a publicly available software in Matlab. We improve on existing scaling methods by introducing outlier analysis, providing methods for computing confidence intervals and statistical testing and introducing a prior, which reduces estimation error when the number of observers is low. Most of our examples focus on image quality assessment.},

  abstract = {The identification of safe gaps between passing cars when crossing a street is a task most of us accomplish successfully on a daily basis. Objectively, how safe a specific gap is, is mainly dependent on how long it would take the approaching vehicle to arrive (time to arrival; TTA). Common sense might suggest that TTA is the basis for pedestrians’ gap selection. However, it has been shown repeatedly that vehicle approach speed has a substantial influence on the size of chosen gaps. At higher speeds, pedestrians tend to accept smaller time gaps, i.e. they initiate riskier crossings. Some researchers have gone so far as to suggest that pedestrians rely more on physical distance of a vehicle in their crossing decisions than TTA. Yet, at the same time, there is evidence that TTA estimates themselves are influenced by object approach speed. It is suspected that pedestrians are more apt to base their decisions on systematically distorted TTA estimates, rather than physical distance. The goal of the two experiments described in this article was to explore the relationship between gap acceptance and TTA estimation. Participants were presented with video clips of approaching vehicles, and were either required to indicate a crossing decision, or to estimate TTA. Results show the typical effects of speed (smaller gaps at higher speed, lower TTA estimate at lower speed) and age (larger gaps for older participants). However, when using subjective time gap size (the TTA estimate) instead of objective time gap size to predict gap acceptance, the effect of speed either disappeared (Experiment I) or decreased substantially (Experiment II). The results indicate that systematic differences in TTA estimates can be a reasonable explanation for the effect of speed on gap acceptance.},

  abstract = {Research in cognitive science has documented numerous phenomena that are approximated by linear relationships. In the domain of numerical cognition, the use of linear regression for estimating linear effects (e.g., distance and SNARC effects) became common following Fias, Brysbaert, Geypens, and d’Ydewalle’s (1996) study on the SNARC effect. While their work has become the model for analyzing linear effects in the field, it requires statistical analysis of individual participants and does not provide measures of the proportions of variability accounted for (cf. Lorch \& Myers, 1990). In the present methodological note, using both the distance and SNARC effects as examples, we demonstrate how linear effects can be estimated in a simple way within the framework of repeated measures analysis of variance. This method allows for estimating effect sizes in terms of both slope and proportions of variability accounted for. Finally, we show that our method can easily be extended to estimate linear interaction effects, not just linear effects calculated as main effects.},

  abstract = {Impulse activity of individual neurons in the nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) was recorded from chair-restrained, unanesthetized cynomolgus monkeys. LC activity was closely related to the behavioral state of the animal. In alert waking, LC neurons displayed continuous, moderately irregular activity. In contrast, prolonged pauses in activity accompanied drowsiness. These pauses preceded eye closure and occurred 1-3 s before the onset of slow-wave EEG. At awakening, LC activation preceded by up to 3 s desynchronized EEG and eye opening. LC activity during alertness varied tonically. During behavioral agitation LC activity was higher than during goal-directed task behavior (described below). In addition to these changes in tonic activity, LC neurons were also phasically responsive to certain sensory stimuli. These cells responded selectively to unexpected, meaningful sounds. LC neurons were also recorded during a visual oddball discrimination task in which the monkey was required to selectively release a lever in response to an infrequent visual cue (target cue; CS+) to receive juice reward. LC neurons were selectively activated by CS+ cues in this task; no other task events evoked LC activity. The mean latency of CS+ response was 108 ms (90 ms for multicell recordings), more than 150 ms prior to the behavioral response (lever release). These responses became smaller in later epochs during the session, along with deteriorating task performance. It is proposed that these short-lasting stimulus-evoked LC responses may help optimize behavioral responses and increase vigilance to subsequent sensory stimuli. Together, LC may contribute both to maintaining tonic levels of vigilance and to phasically modulating the current vigilance level in a stimulus-dependent mode.},

Here, we varied the discrimination difficulty in this task and recorded impulse activity of LC neurons to analyze LC responses on error trials and in relation to behavioral response times (RTs). In easy and difficult discrimination conditions, LC neurons responded preferentially to target stimuli with phasic activation. These responses consistently preceded behavioral responses regardless of task difficulty. Latencies for LC and behavioral responses increased similarly for difficult compared with easy discrimination trials. LC response latencies were also shorter for fast RT trials compared with slow RT trials regardless of difficulty, indicating a close temporal relationship between LC and behavioral responses. This relationship was confirmed with response-locked histograms of LC activity, which yielded more temporally synchronized LC responses than stimulus-locked histograms. Population histograms of LC activity revealed that nontarget stimuli resulting in false alarm responses produced phasic LC activation (although smaller than for target-hit trials), and nontarget stimuli resulting in correct rejection responses yielded a small inhibition in LC activity. Population analyses also revealed that LC responses included an early, small excitatory component that was not previously detected. This early response was nondiscriminative because it was similar for target and nontarget stimulus trials. These results indicate that LC neurons exhibit early small magnitude responses that are closely linked to sensory stimuli. In addition, these cells show a later, larger magnitude response that is temporally linked to behavioral responses. These and other results lead us to hypothesize that LC responses are driven by decision processes and help facilitate subsequent behavioral responses.},

The necessary sample size to achieve stable estimates for correlations depends on the effect size, the width of the corridor of stability (i.e., a corridor around the true value where deviations are tolerated), and the requested confidence that the trajectory does not leave this corridor any more. Results indicate that in typical scenarios the sample size should approach 250 for stable estimates.},

Despite these criticisms, this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it appeals to researcher’s intuition to collect more data to push an indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution, we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure, which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached. This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF design typically needs 50\% to 70\% smaller samples to reach a conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same or lower long-term rate of wrong inference.

Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology’s lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and large-N designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

  abstract = {Depressive symptomatology is manifested in greater first-person singular pronoun use (i.e., Italk), but when and for whom this effect is most apparent, and the extent to which it is specific to depression or part of a broader association between negative emotionality and I-talk, remains unclear. Using pooled data from N = 4,754 participants from 6 labs across 2 countries, we examined, in a preregistered analysis, how the depression–I-talk effect varied by (a) first-person singular pronoun type (i.e., subjective, objective, and possessive), (b) the communication context in which language was generated (i.e., personal, momentary thought, identity-related, and impersonal), and (c) gender. Overall, there was a small but reliable positive correlation between depression and I-talk (r = .10, 95\% CI [.07, .13]). The effect was present for all first-person singular pronouns except the possessive type, in all communication contexts except the impersonal one, and for both females and males with little evidence of gender differences. Importantly, a similar pattern of results emerged for negative emotionality. Further, the depression–I-talk effect was substantially reduced when controlled for negative emotionality but this was not the case when the negative emotionality–I-talk effect was controlled for depression. These results suggest that the robust empirical link between depression and I-talk largely reflects a broader association between negative emotionality and I-talk. Self-referential language using first-person singular pronouns may therefore be better construed as a linguistic marker of general distress proneness or negative emotionality rather than as a specific marker of depression.},

We explore the idea that norepinephrine is an essential modulator of memory through its ability to regulate synaptic mechanisms. Emotional arousal leads to activation of the locus coeruleus with the subsequent release of norepineprine in the brain, resulting in the enhancement of memory. Norepinephrine activates both pre- and post-synaptic adrenergic receptors at central synapses with different functional outcomes, depending on the expression pattern of these receptors in specific neural circuitries underlying distinct behavioral processes. We review the evidence for noradrenergic modulation of synaptic plasticity with consideration of how this may contribute to the mechanisms of learning and memory.},

In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

Study hypotheses are expressed as a sequence of linear models for the outcome variable adjusted score on the Bayley Scales of Mental Development (MDIA), as a function of cord blood-lead concentration, infant blood-lead concentration at semiannual examinations, and other characteristics of study participants. These models are fitted to MDIA measurements on three occasions for as many as 214 infants, first assuming an arbitrary multivariate covariance structure for the repeated measurements and then with covariance structure arising from a random-effects model for errors. Estimates of the effects of lead exposure are not sensitive to the assumed covariance structure. The article describes several approaches to residual analysis and outlier detection in the longitudinal setting. In particular, it shows how empirical Bayes residuals can be used to estimate the partial regression coefficient of covariates not included in the linear model. The major findings concerning the effect of lead exposure on cognitive development are (a) a clear association between cord blood-lead concentration and Bayley scores in the first 18 months of life, (b) no clear evidence of an effect of cumulative postnatal exposure, and (c) a tendency for children who had higher lead concentrations at 6 months of age to exhibit poorer performance at 18 months than children with low lead concentrations. These findings have implications for acceptable blood-lead concentrations in children and pregnant women.},

statisticians to fit linear mixed models (LMMs) to continuous dependent
variables in clustered or longitudinal data sets. LMMs are flexible tools for
analyzing relationships among variables in these types of data sets, in that a
variety of covariance structures can be used depending on the subject matter
under study. The explicit random effects in LMMs allow analysts to make
inferences about the variability between clusters or subjects in larger
hypothetical populations, and examine cluster- or subject-level variables that
explain portions of this variability. These models can also be used to analyze
longitudinal or clustered data sets with data that are missing at random (MAR),
and can accommodate time-varying covariates in longitudinal data sets. While the
software procedures currently available have many features in common, more
specific analytic aspects of fitting LMMs (e.g., crossed random effects,
appropriate hypothesis testing for variance components, diagnostics,
incorporating sampling weights) may only be available in selected software
procedures. With this article, we aim to perform a comprehensive and up-to-date
comparison of the current capabilities of software procedures for fitting LMMs,
and provide statisticians with a guide for selecting a software procedure
appropriate for their analytic goals.},

A comparison of these steps across the two domains reveals both (a) formal parallelism, and (b) important differences in the way calibration is intended and implemented. We examine the similarities and differences to determine whether this is a case of irreducible difference, or whether the similarities are such that measurement in the two domains can be viewed within a single conceptualization.},

The evidence has been derived from the authors' findings related to the optimum spacing of repetitions in paired-associate learning. The two components are sufficient to explain the optimum spacing of repetitions as well as the spacing effect. Although the molecular counterparts of the two components of memory are not known, the authors provide a collection of guidelines that might facilitate identification of such counterparts.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We set out to measure healthy subjects' estimates of temporal duration during the imagination of left and right sides of an object located in either near or far representational space. BACKGROUND: Duration estimates during the observation of small-scale scenes are shorter than those during the observation of the same scenes presented in a larger scale. It is not known whether a similar space-time relationship also exists for objects merely imagined and whether subjective time varies with a forced focus on either the left or the right side of a mental image. METHODS: Eyes closed, 40 healthy, right-handed subjects (20 women) had to imagine a standard Swiss railway clock either at a distance of 30 cm or 6 m. They were required to focus on the imagined movement of the second hand and provide estimates of elapsed durations of 15 and 30 seconds. Separate estimates for the left and right side of the clockface were obtained. The magnitude of implicit line bisection error was assessed in a separate task. RESULTS: Irrespective of side of the clockface, duration estimates were shorter for the clockface imagined in far space than for the one imagined immediately in front of the inner eye. For men, but not women, duration judgments (left relative to right side of the clockface) correlated with relative lengths of left and right line segments in the bisection task. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective time seems to run faster during the inspection of a small-size compared with a larger-size mental image. This finding underlines the equivalence of the laws that guide both exploration and representation of space. Together with the observed correlation between spatial and temporal measures of lateral asymmetries, the result also illustrates the conceptual similarities in the processing of space and time. The normative data presented here may be useful for clinical applications of the paradigm in patients with hemispatial neglect or a distorted perception of time.},

  abstract = {(from the chapter) We first proposed that frequency of occurrence information is 'automatically' encoded in the context of a general theoretical framework relating attention and memory encoding (Hasher and Zacks 1979). This chapter begins with a description of the origins of that framework, focusing on earlier evidence indicating that people of all ages and under a very broad range of circumstances reliably and unintentionally encode information about the relative frequencies of events. Notwithstanding challenges to the automatic encoding view, we believe this empirical generalization remains valid today. Additionally, we describe recent examples of findings from research on language processing and statistical reasoning that add to earlier evidence of the critical contribution of frequency knowledge to cognitive and social functioning. Finally, we note that, in a number of respects, the broader intellectual climate in psychology today is more consistent with our approach to memory encoding than was the intellectual climate of the 1970s.
