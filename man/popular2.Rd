\description{
The popularity data in popular2 are simulated data for 2000 pupils in 100
schools. The purpose is to offer a very simple example for multilevel
regression analysis. The main outcome variable is the pupil popularity, a
popularity rating on a scale of 1â€“10 derived by a sociometric procedure.
Typically, a sociometric procedure asks all pupils in a class to rate all the
other pupils, and then assigns the average received popularity rating to each
pupil. Because of the sociometric procedure, group effects as apparent from
higher-level variance components are rather strong. There is a second outcome
variable: pupil popularity as rated by their teacher, on a scale from 1 to
10. The explanatory variables are pupil gender (boy = 0, girl = 1), pupil
extraversion (10-point scale), and teacher experience in years.
